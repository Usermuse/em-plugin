  Craft an inspiring, achievable product vision anchored in customers' own words
  about the future they want — not internal aspiration alone. Use when the user
  says 'write a product vision', 'vision statement', 'what's our north star',
  'align the team on direction', 'where are we headed', or 'refine our vision'.
  Trigger terms: product vision, vision statement, north star, aspirational
  direction, team alignment, future state. Not for quarterly goals or roadmaps —
  this is the long-horizon why.

# Product Vision

Brainstorm a product vision that is inspiring, achievable, and emotional — and grounded in the future customers themselves describe wanting. A vision built from customer-desired-outcome quotes lands as credible and shared, not as a slogan invented in a room.

## Step 0 — Relevance & availability
Confirm this is product-direction work and Evermuse is connected. If not, produce a framework-only vision labeled **⚠ ungrounded — Evermuse not connected** and tell the user to authorize the MCP. See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/using-evermuse/SKILL.md` Step 0.

## Evermuse Grounding (required)
Follow `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/using-evermuse/SKILL.md`.

**Required — one parallel batch of searches.** Verify the product (Rule 1), then fire in a single parallel batch:
- **3–4 `evidence` searches**, each worded from a different angle (`limit` up to 50). Evidence comes back rich and varied — expect large, useful result sets.
- **one `guidance` search** and **one `context` search** (`limit` up to 50). These are usually sparse or empty; run them anyway and note when they're thin.

Read each response's **digest** — it reports how many more results exist. Use judgment on whether a query is worth pulling deeper (raise `limit` toward the 100 max and/or page with `next_offset` to avoid repeats), weighing payload size, remaining context, task complexity, and the value of the data. For deep pulls, consider spawning sub-agents — instruct them to return every citation with the **same metadata the tools return** (`url`, `who_said_it`, `meeting_name`, `created_at`) so you can still cite.

**Optional — considered use.** Once grounded, reach for the other tools only when they add value: a quote-angled `search` for verbatim voice, `read_source` for a single deep dive, inline citations (`references/citations.md`), and `add_source` to save the deliverable. Sources, citations, and saving are optional — not required.

## Instructions

You are a veteran product leader developing a vision for **$ARGUMENTS**. A great vision is memorable, communicable in one sentence, and makes people *feel* something.

The vision must be:
1. **Inspiring** — motivates the team to commit.
2. **Achievable** — credible given resources, market, and capabilities.
3. **Emotional** — creates meaning and connection.

### Process
1. Read any existing vision/values from the `guidance` search — evolve it, don't discard it.
2. Identify the **core problem** and, more importantly, **the future customers say they want** — pulled verbatim from evidence. This is the anchor: the vision describes the world customers are asking for, in their words.
3. Draft **3–5 vision variations**, each traceable to clustered customer-desired-outcome quotes.
4. Select the strongest; explain the rationale in terms of the customer aspiration it captures and the market shift (context) that makes it timely.
5. Show how it aligns with company values (guidance) and the market opportunity (context).

Where the source reaches for "files from the workspace," use Evermuse `evidence` — customers' own words about the future they want — as the primary source.

## Deliverable format

```markdown
# Product Vision — [product]

**Vision (recommended):** "[one memorable sentence in customers' own register]"

*Why this one:* it captures the future customers keep describing —
> "[verbatim quote about the outcome they want]" — [attribution] [`1`](URL)

**Alternatives considered:** [2–4 short variants, each tagged to the evidence cluster it came from]

**Alignment:** values [guidance [`1`](URL)] · market tailwind [context [`2`](URL)]
```

Keep it honest: if evidence for a desired future is thin, say so and mark the vision as a hypothesis worth testing in interviews (`/evermuse:interview` if available).
