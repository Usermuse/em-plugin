  Build a product strategy on the 9-section Product Strategy Canvas where every
  pillar is anchored in real customer evidence and market context, not
  guesswork. Use when the user says 'build a product strategy', 'what's our
  strategy', 'define our product direction', 'strategic plan', 'how do we win',
  or 'where should we focus'. Trigger terms: product strategy, strategy canvas,
  strategic plan, product direction, how we win, defensibility, north star. Not
  for sprint plans or individual feature specs — this is company-level
  direction.

# Product Strategy Canvas

Produce a comprehensive Product Strategy Canvas — vision, segments, costs, value props, trade-offs, metrics, growth, capabilities, defensibility — where each pillar cites the customer pains that justify it and the market shifts that make it timely. Grounding turns a plausible-sounding strategy into one you can defend with quotes.

## Step 0 — Relevance & availability
Confirm this is product/company-direction work and Evermuse is connected. If the tools aren't present, produce a framework-only canvas labeled **⚠ ungrounded — Evermuse not connected** and tell the user to authorize the MCP. See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/using-evermuse/SKILL.md` Step 0.

## Evermuse Grounding (required)
Follow `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/using-evermuse/SKILL.md`.

**Required — one parallel batch of searches.** Verify the product (Rule 1), then fire in a single parallel batch:
- **3–4 `evidence` searches**, each worded from a different angle (`limit` up to 50). Evidence comes back rich and varied — expect large, useful result sets.
- **one `guidance` search** and **one `context` search** (`limit` up to 50). These are usually sparse or empty; run them anyway and note when they're thin.

Read each response's **digest** — it reports how many more results exist. Use judgment on whether a query is worth pulling deeper (raise `limit` toward the 100 max and/or page with `next_offset` to avoid repeats), weighing payload size, remaining context, task complexity, and the value of the data. For deep pulls, consider spawning sub-agents — instruct them to return every citation with the **same metadata the tools return** (`url`, `who_said_it`, `meeting_name`, `created_at`) so you can still cite.

**Optional — considered use.** Once grounded, reach for the other tools only when they add value: a quote-angled `search` for verbatim voice, `read_source` for a single deep dive, inline citations (`references/citations.md`), and `add_source` to save the deliverable. Sources, citations, and saving are optional — not required.

## Instructions

You are an experienced product strategist developing a strategy for **$ARGUMENTS**. Build the canvas so its elements reinforce each other and every choice traces to evidence.

### The 9-Section Product Strategy Canvas

1. **Vision** — What we aspire to achieve and the values we uphold. Anchor in the future customers say they want (evidence quotes about desired outcomes), not internal ambition alone.
2. **Market Segments** — Defined by *problems people have*, not demographics. State each segment's Job to Be Done, desired outcome, and constraint. **Each segment's problem comes from an `evidence` result, cited.** Name the first segment and why it goes first (strongest, most-cited pain wins).
3. **Relative Costs** — Do we optimize for low cost (Southwest) or unique value (Starbucks)? State cost position vs. competitors; back competitor claims with `context`.
4. **Value Proposition** (per segment) — *What before* (the pain, quoted from evidence) → *How* (our mechanism) → *What after* (the outcome customers named) → *Alternatives* (what they use today, from evidence/context). **Every pillar cites a pain [evidence] and a market shift [context].**
5. **Trade-offs** — What we will NOT do. Use evidence to justify saying no (segments whose pains we deprioritize, and why that focus amplifies value for the chosen segment).
6. **Key Metrics** — North Star Metric + the One Metric That Matters this quarter. Tie the North Star to the customer outcome in the value prop.
7. **Growth** — Product-Led vs. Sales-Led; primary acquisition channels; unit-economics logic. Ground channel choice in where evidence shows customers actually discover tools like ours.
8. **Capabilities** — Competencies/resources to build vs. partner for, to win the chosen segment.
9. **Can't/Won't** — Why competitors can't or won't copy the *integrated* set of choices (network effects, switching costs, IP). Cite `context` on competitor capabilities where relevant (secondary — label it).

### Output process
1. Draft vision from customer-desired-future evidence.
2. Identify 2–3 segments, each grounded in a cited pain.
3. Set cost positioning.
4. Write value props with paired [evidence]+[context] citations.
5. State explicit trade-offs with rationale.
6. Set North Star + OMTM.
7. Outline growth and capabilities.
8. Explain defensibility.
9. **Coherence check:** do the nine reinforce each other? Surface the critical hypotheses that must be true, and one cheap experiment per hypothesis.

Where the source method reaches for "web search / user-provided data," use Evermuse `evidence` (customer voice) as the primary source and `context` (market) as secondary.

## Deliverable format

```markdown
# Product Strategy — [product]

**1. Vision:** [one memorable sentence] — grounded in [`1`](URL)

**2. Market Segments**
- **Segment A (first):** [JTBD]. Core pain: > "[quote]" — [attribution] [`2`](URL). Why first: [most-cited].

**4. Value Proposition — Segment A**
| Before (pain) | How | After (outcome) | Alternatives |
|---|---|---|---|
| [pain, cited [`3`](URL)] | [mechanism] | [outcome, cited [`4`](URL)] | [today's tools] |
*Market shift making this winnable now:* [context, cited [`5`](URL)]

… (sections 3, 5–9) …

**Critical hypotheses & cheapest tests**
- [hypothesis] → [test]
```
