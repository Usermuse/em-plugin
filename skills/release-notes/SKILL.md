  Generate user-facing release notes / changelogs from tickets, PRDs, or git
  logs — organized by new features, improvements, fixes — with a 'You asked, we
  built' angle that finds the real customers who requested each shipped item via
  Evermuse. Use when the user wants to 'write release notes', 'create a
  changelog', 'announce what shipped', 'draft product update notes', or 'you
  asked we built'. Trigger terms: release notes, changelog, product update, what
  shipped, announcement notes, you asked we built. Not for internal-only
  engineering changelogs with no customer-facing change.

# Release Notes ("You asked, we built") — grounded in customer requests

Turn tickets/PRDs/git logs for $ARGUMENTS into polished, user-facing release notes — and make them land harder by **naming the customers who actually asked for each shipped item**. Internally, quote the requesters; externally, count them ("requested by 12 accounts"). This closes the loop and turns a changelog into evidence that you listen.

## Step 0 — Relevance & availability
Confirm these are customer-facing changes and Evermuse is present. If the MCP isn't connected, produce the notes from the raw material but label them **⚠ ungrounded** (no "you asked" attribution) and tell the user to authorize the MCP. (See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/using-evermuse/SKILL.md`, Step 0.)

## Evermuse Grounding (required)
Follow `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/using-evermuse/SKILL.md`.

**Required — one parallel batch of searches.** Verify the product (Rule 1), then fire in a single parallel batch:
- **3–4 `evidence` searches**, each worded from a different angle (`limit` up to 50). Evidence comes back rich and varied — expect large, useful result sets.
- **one `guidance` search** and **one `context` search** (`limit` up to 50). These are usually sparse or empty; run them anyway and note when they're thin.

Read each response's **digest** — it reports how many more results exist. Use judgment on whether a query is worth pulling deeper (raise `limit` toward the 100 max and/or page with `next_offset` to avoid repeats), weighing payload size, remaining context, task complexity, and the value of the data. For deep pulls, consider spawning sub-agents — instruct them to return every citation with the **same metadata the tools return** (`url`, `who_said_it`, `meeting_name`, `created_at`) so you can still cite.

**Optional — considered use.** Once grounded, reach for the other tools only when they add value: a quote-angled `search` for verbatim voice, `read_source` for a single deep dive, inline citations (`references/citations.md`), and `add_source` to save the deliverable. Sources, citations, and saving are optional — not required.

## Instructions

1. **Extract from raw material.** Read all provided tickets, PRDs, git logs, changelogs. For each: what changed, who it affects, why it matters (the user benefit). Replace the source skill's "web search for product context" with the Evermuse corpus.
2. **Categorize:** New Features · Improvements · Bug Fixes · Breaking Changes (action required) · Deprecations.
3. **Write benefit-first, jargon-free.** 1–3 sentences per entry; lead with the user outcome, not the technical change. (e.g. "Dashboards load 3× faster" not "added Redis caching layer".)
4. **Add the "You asked, we built" layer per item:**
   - a quote-angled `search` + an `evidence` `search` on the item's topic → the customers who asked.
   - **Internal cut:** quote 1–2 requesters verbatim, attributed and cited. [`1`](URL)
   - **External cut:** aggregate to a number — "Requested by 12 accounts" — no names or quotes.
   - If nothing in the corpus maps to an item, ship it plainly (don't invent a requester).
5. **Flag follow-up opportunities (optional).** For high-demand items, offer to notify the specific requesters that their ask shipped, with a ready-to-send draft + the requester list.
   Never send without explicit user go-ahead.
6. **Match the product's voice** — B2B professional, consumer friendly, or developer-focused.

## Output
Two cuts when grounded: an **internal** version (with requester quotes cited inline) and an **external** version (aggregated counts, publish-ready). Plus an optional **follow-up list** of requesters per item.
