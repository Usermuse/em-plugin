  Generate the ship-readiness documentation set for an AI-built (vibe-coded)
  feature — architecture, flows, permissions, variables, and a tests coverage
  map, plus conditional docs — and reconstruct the missing 'intent' section from
  Evermuse shaping notes, the local spec, and customer evidence so a reviewer
  can judge whether the code matches what was meant. Use when the user wants to
  'document this app for review', 'prep for a security/perf audit', 'create
  shipping docs', 'map the flows and permissions', or 'get this ready to ship'.
  Trigger terms: shipping artifacts, ship readiness, document the app, review
  docs, pre-ship documentation, flows and permissions map. Not for user-facing
  docs — this is reviewer/auditor documentation.

# Shipping Artifacts (intent reconstructed from customer evidence)

AI agents write code fast but leave no durable record of **intent** — what the system was *supposed* to do and why. This skill produces the small set of reviewer-facing docs that restore reviewability for $ARGUMENTS, and fills the intent gap by reconstructing it from **Evermuse shaping notes + the local spec + customer evidence**. Without that intent layer, an audit has nothing to compare the code against.

> **Pairs with the gap-analysis flagship.** These docs are the *intended-state* half; `gap-analysis` is the *audit* that compares intent ↔ code ↔ customer need. Produce shipping artifacts first, then run `gap-analysis` against them.

## Step 0 — Relevance & availability
Confirm there's a built feature to document and Evermuse is present. The code-derived docs work ungrounded, but the **intent reconstruction** needs the MCP — if it's not connected, produce the doc set and label the intent sections **⚠ ungrounded — intent not reconstructed from evidence**; tell the user to authorize the MCP. (See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/using-evermuse/SKILL.md`, Step 0.)

## Evermuse Grounding (required)
Follow `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/using-evermuse/SKILL.md`. For shipping artifacts:

- **Ground (intent).** Verify the product (Rule 1). Reconstruct intent from three sources: **shaping notes** via `get_shaping_notes` → `read_shaping_note` (the internal shaping record — secondary, but the closest thing to recorded intent); the **local spec** (`specs/<feature>/spec.md`, PRD, or plan); and **customer evidence** — run **2–3 `evidence` searches** on the feature's purpose + `find_supporting_quotes(topic, limit: 5)` for the pains the feature was meant to solve.
- **Work.** Write the core + applicable conditional docs into `/documentation/`, reverse-engineered from the code, with the intent/assumptions grounded in the above.
- **Cite.** The intent + "Known risks/assumptions" entries that rest on customer signal carry an inline linked-number badge [`1`](URL). Cite every customer-derived claim inline per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/using-evermuse/references/citations.md` — a linked-number code badge [`1`](URL). Keep shaping notes labeled as **secondary/internal**, never as customer ground truth.
- **Save.** After confirmation, `add_source(nature: "guidance", source_type: "document", title: "Shipping artifacts — <feature>", tags: ["evermuse-plugin","shipping"])`. Ship-readiness docs are company direction → **guidance**.

## The doc set (core + conditional)

Write into `/documentation/`. Core docs always; conditional docs only when the capability exists — if it doesn't, write one honest line in `architecture.md` ("No scheduled work — no `cron.md`.") rather than an empty file. Be an accurate map, not a clean bill of health.

**Core**
1. **`architecture.md`** — product overview + **key assumptions** (grounded in reconstructed intent [`1`](URL)); tech stack; how auth/sessions/claims flow; trust boundaries; a **Known risks / assumptions** list (each backed by where it shows up in code); a "Related Documents" index.
2. **`flows.md`** — each load-bearing flow as actor + precondition + success outcome; the UI→server→data→jobs→providers→agents sequence; the **authz check at each protected step** (claim/role/scope, resource, expected *deny*); **trust-boundary crossings**; side effects. *Anti-PRD rule: only flows touching permissions, data integrity, external side effects, money, privacy, or safety belong here.*
3. **`permissions.md`** — roles/claims; where scope is derived (token vs DB); a resource × operation × role matrix; which tables use RLS vs code-enforced checks.
4. **`variables.md`** — table of Name · used-by · scope · source · rotation · risk; explicit "no secret bundled client-side" confirmation; a pre-go-live checklist.
5. **`tests.md`** — the verification map in three separated sections so it can't read falsely green: **Existing coverage** (tests in the repo today, each tied to the rule it pins) · **Proposed tests** (marked by type) · **Gaps** (documented rules verified by nothing, ranked by exposure). Note CI-required checks. *(In the source method this is derived separately from the other docs — treat it as the "documented == implemented" check.)*

**Conditional (include only if the capability exists)**
6. **`emails.md`** — queue→processor→provider path, templates + inputs, retry, where sends fail. *(if it sends email)*
7. **`cron.md`** — job inventory (schedule · function · secrets · limits · retry), idempotency, internal-call auth. *(if scheduled/background jobs exist)*
8. **`seo.md`** — preview approach, route→needs-SEO→public-data-only table, metadata sanitization, bot-vs-human routing. *(if public/indexable routes exist)*
9. **`automation.md`** — per embedded agent/automation: trigger + owner + auto-vs-approval; inputs it reads + **exact tools/APIs it may call**; steering (prompt) vs hard guardrails; output contract; app-owned side effects vs agent-owned suggestions; controls (approval gates, audit logging, rate limits, kill switch). *(if the app embeds agents/LLM workflows/webhooks)*

## Notes
- Each doc registers itself in `architecture.md` under "Related Documents".
- Keep templates/examples out — these describe *this* system.
- The customer-evidence layer is what makes intent real: a "Known risk" like "assumes one workspace per user" should trace to code **and**, where relevant, to a customer who hit the multi-workspace case [`1`](URL).
