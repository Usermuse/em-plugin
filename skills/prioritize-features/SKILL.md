# Prioritize Features (scored on real demand)

Rank a backlog to find the top 5 to pursue. The Evermuse difference: **Reach and Impact aren't gut numbers** — they come from counting how many distinct accounts actually asked, and how sharply, in real conversations. A backlog scored on evidence looks different from one scored on the loudest stakeholder.

## Step 0 — Relevance & availability
Confirm this is backlog prioritization and Evermuse is connected (see `using-evermuse` Step 0). If disconnected, you can still apply the frameworks, but every Reach/Impact number is a guess — label the output **⚠ ungrounded** and say the scores are unvalidated.

## Evermuse Grounding (required)
Follow `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/using-evermuse/SKILL.md`.

**Required — one parallel batch of searches.** Verify the product (Rule 1), then fire in a single parallel batch:
- **3–4 `evidence` searches**, each worded from a different angle (`limit` up to 50). Evidence comes back rich and varied — expect large, useful result sets.
- **one `guidance` search** and **one `context` search** (`limit` up to 50). These are usually sparse or empty; run them anyway and note when they're thin.

Read each response's **digest** — it reports how many more results exist. Use judgment on whether a query is worth pulling deeper (raise `limit` toward the 100 max and/or page with `next_offset` to avoid repeats), weighing payload size, remaining context, task complexity, and the value of the data. For deep pulls, consider spawning sub-agents — instruct them to return every citation with the **same metadata the tools return** (`url`, `who_said_it`, `meeting_name`, `created_at`) so you can still cite.

**Optional — considered use.** Once grounded, reach for the other tools only when they add value: a quote-angled `search` for verbatim voice, `read_source` for a single deep dive, inline citations (`references/citations.md`), and `add_source` to save the deliverable. Sources, citations, and saving are optional — not required.

## Instructions

1. **Confirm the objective and success metric.** Prioritization is meaningless without the outcome you're ranking against. Ask if it's not stated.

2. **Ground each item in demand.** For every feature, pull its real signal: how many distinct accounts asked, the sentiment, and one verbatim quote. Prioritize **problems (opportunities), not solutions** — "never allow customers to design solutions."

3. **Score with an evidence-fed framework** (details in `references/prioritization-frameworks.md`):
   - **Reach** = number of distinct accounts affected — **from the evidence count**, not a guess.
   - **Impact** = Opportunity Score (Importance × (1 − Satisfaction)) where the corpus reveals importance and dissatisfaction — value per customer.
   - **Confidence** = how sure are we? Higher when the evidence is thick and consistent, lower when it's one account.
   - **Effort** = dev/design/coordination cost.
   RICE = (R × I × C) / E · ICE = I × C × E · Opportunity Score for problem-ranking.

4. **`get_opportunities` is a labeled cross-check only.** You may pull Evermuse's machine-suggested opportunities to sanity-check your ranking, but present them explicitly as **"AI-generated cross-check (not customer ground truth)"** — never let them override the evidence-backed scores.

5. **Recommend the top 5** with ranking, rationale naming the evidence, key trade-offs, and **what was deprioritized and why**.

## Deliverable

```markdown
**Objective:** [outcome being ranked against]

| # | Feature | Reach (accounts) | Impact (Opp. Score) | Conf | Effort | Score | Evidence |
|---|---------|------------------|---------------------|------|--------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Scheduled export | 6 | 0.72 | High | M | … | > "[quote]" [`1`](URL) |
| 2 | … | 3 | 0.55 | Med | S | … | [`2`](URL) |

**Deprioritized:** [feature] — [why, e.g. "only 1 account, low importance"].

**AI-generated cross-check (not ground truth):** roadmap suggests … — [agrees/differs with evidence ranking].
```
