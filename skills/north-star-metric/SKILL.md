# North Star Metric

Define a single, customer-centric North Star Metric and the 3–5 input metrics that drive it (a metrics constellation / input tree). The Evermuse twist: the North Star must reflect the **value customers actually describe getting** in real conversations — not a revenue proxy or a vanity number. You ground the value definition in quotes, then pick the metric that best captures it.

## Step 0 — Relevance & availability
Confirm this is a metrics-definition task and Evermuse is connected. If the tools aren't present, produce a framework-only NSM labeled **⚠ ungrounded — Evermuse not connected** and tell the user to authorize the MCP. See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/using-evermuse/SKILL.md` Step 0.

## Evermuse Grounding (required)
Follow `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/using-evermuse/SKILL.md`.

**Required — one parallel batch of searches.** Verify the product (Rule 1), then fire in a single parallel batch:
- **3–4 `evidence` searches**, each worded from a different angle (`limit` up to 50). Evidence comes back rich and varied — expect large, useful result sets.
- **one `guidance` search** and **one `context` search** (`limit` up to 50). These are usually sparse or empty; run them anyway and note when they're thin.

Read each response's **digest** — it reports how many more results exist. Use judgment on whether a query is worth pulling deeper (raise `limit` toward the 100 max and/or page with `next_offset` to avoid repeats), weighing payload size, remaining context, task complexity, and the value of the data. For deep pulls, consider spawning sub-agents — instruct them to return every citation with the **same metadata the tools return** (`url`, `who_said_it`, `meeting_name`, `created_at`) so you can still cite.

**Optional — considered use.** Once grounded, reach for the other tools only when they add value: a quote-angled `search` for verbatim voice, `read_source` for a single deep dive, inline citations (`references/citations.md`), and `add_source` to save the deliverable. Sources, citations, and saving are optional — not required.

## Instructions

You are a metrics strategist defining the North Star for **$ARGUMENTS**. Where the source method reaches for "business context you provide," use Evermuse `evidence` (how customers describe value) as the primary input.

**NSM is NOT** multiple metrics, a revenue/LTV metric, an OKR, or a strategy. **NSM IS** a single customer-centric KPI reflecting the value customers get and leading long-term business success.

### Step 1 — Classify the business game
Determine which game the product plays; it shapes the North Star family:
- **Attention** — time customers spend (Spotify, YouTube).
- **Transaction** — exchanges between customer and platform (Uber, Airbnb, Amazon).
- **Productivity** — how efficiently someone completes work or reaches a goal (Notion, Canva, Loom).
Ground the pick: which framing matches the value customers actually describe? Cite it.

### Step 2 — Define the North Star from evidenced value
State the single metric that captures the core value customers named. Validate against the **7 criteria**: (1) easy to understand, (2) customer-centric, (3) reflects sustainable value/habit, (4) aligned to vision, (5) quantitative, (6) actionable, (7) leading indicator. Show the metric passing each — and tie criterion (2) directly to a customer quote about value.

### Step 3 — Build the input-metric tree (3–5)
Define the input metrics that most directly drive the North Star. Each input should be easier to move short-term, provably contribute to the North Star outcome, and point to where teams optimize. Draw the tree: **North Star = f(input₁, input₂, …)**. For each input, prefer a good-metric shape — a **ratio or rate**, comparative over time, and behavior-changing ("if it won't change what you do, it's a bad metric"). Distinguish leading from lagging, and note where a qualitative signal (customer complaints, sentiment from the corpus) is the earliest leading indicator.

### Step 4 — Guardrails (brief)
Name 1–2 health guardrails so optimizing the North Star doesn't quietly harm the customer (e.g. quality, latency, churn). This is the useful half of a metrics dashboard — not a full ops dashboard; for that, keep it out of scope.

## Deliverable format

```markdown
# North Star — [product]

**Business game:** [Attention / Transaction / Productivity] — because [evidenced value, [`1`](URL)].

**North Star Metric:** [metric]
**Why it captures value:** > "[customer quote about the value]" — [attribution] [`2`](URL)
**7-criteria check:** [✓ understandable · ✓ customer-centric [`2`](URL) · ✓ sustainable · ✓ vision-aligned [`3`](URL) · ✓ quantitative · ✓ actionable · ✓ leading]

**Input-metric tree**  (North Star = f(inputs))
| Input metric | Shape (ratio/rate) | How it drives NSM | Lead/Lag |
|---|---|---|---|
| [input 1] | [rate] | [link, cited [`4`](URL)] | Leading |

**Guardrails:** [health metric 1], [health metric 2].
```

## Honesty when evidence is thin
If customers don't clearly articulate the value, say so — a North Star built on a guessed value definition is fragile. Flag it as a hypothesis and suggest interviews (`/evermuse:interview` if available) to confirm the value the metric is meant to track.

## Save & hand off
After saving, offer: **"Wire this into the GTM plan's metrics?"** (`/evermuse:gtm-strategy`), or **"Define the ICP whose value this measures?"** (`/evermuse:ideal-customer-profile`).
