  Show the user everything Evermuse can do — announce it in chat, then render the
  interactive list-capabilities picker of every agentic skill, grouped by
  category, and wait for them to pick one. Use when the user picks "See all new
  capabilities", runs find_skills:list-capabilities, or asks 'what can you do',
  'what can Evermuse do', 'show me all the skills', 'what are my options', 'list
  your capabilities', or 'help me get started'. Trigger terms: what can you do,
  list capabilities, show all skills, what are my options, capabilities menu,
  what can Evermuse do, help me choose.

# List Capabilities (the capabilities picker)

The front door to everything Evermuse can do: a color-coded, category-grouped picker of every agentic skill. This skill is how a user who doesn't yet know what to ask for finds their footing — reached from the post-ingestion view's "See all new capabilities" option, via `/evermuse:list-capabilities`, or whenever someone asks "what can you do?". The job is to frame the moment in chat, render the picker, and let the user choose.


## Steps in sequence

### 1. Announce the menu in chat

First output **exactly** this title and subtitle as your chat message:

H1 TITLE: **What would you like to achieve today?**
SUBTITLE: Below are a list of things I can do for you with Evermuse.


### 2. Render a custom list of capabilities
