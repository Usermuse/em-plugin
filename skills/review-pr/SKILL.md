  Review a pull request against three things at once: code quality, the spec it
  was meant to satisfy, and the actual customer asks behind it — calling out
  where the diff diverges from what customers literally requested. Use when the
  user asks to 'review this PR', 'review the diff', 'check this PR against the
  spec', or wants a customer-voice-aware code review. Trigger terms: review this
  PR, review the diff, PR review, check against the spec, does this match what
  customers asked. Defer to a dedicated code-review tool if the user names one
  and only wants code quality.

# Review a PR (against code, spec, and customer voice)

A normal review asks "is the code good?" This one also asks "does it build what was specified?" and — uniquely — "does it match what customers actually asked for?" That third pass catches the gaps other reviews miss: the export that works but drops the header row a customer explicitly needed.

## Step 0 — Relevance & availability
Confirm this is a customer-facing PR and Evermuse is available. If the user only wants code-quality feedback (or names a dedicated reviewer), do that and skip the customer lens.

## Fetch the PR
Prefer `gh pr view <n>` / `gh pr diff <n>` (or the current branch's diff). Optionally try the Evermuse third-party bridge to GitHub (`find_tool` → `call_tool`); **degrade gracefully** to `gh` if it's blocked (see `third-party-bridge.md`). If neither works, ask the user to paste the diff.

## Find the intent
What was this PR *supposed* to do?
1. **Shaping notes** carry `branch` and `PR number` fields — `get_shaping_notes` and match on the PR/branch, then `read_shaping_note` for the intent and its citations.
2. Else a local `specs/<feature>/spec.md`.
3. Else ask the user for the intended behavior in a sentence.

## Ground in the customer's asks
Run 2–3 `evidence` searches + `find_supporting_quotes` for the feature area, so you know what customers literally requested about *this* behavior. This is what powers Pass 3.

## Three review passes
1. **Code quality** — correctness, edge cases, error handling, security, tests, style/conventions. Standard, focused review; report only real issues.
2. **Spec conformance** — does the diff satisfy each relevant FR-###? Note requirements that are unmet, partially met, or exceeded (scope creep).
3. **Customer-voice conformance** — does the *behavior* match what customers asked for? Quote-vs-diff mismatches are the headline:
   > Customer asked: "export with the header row, we paste into our template" [`1`](URL). The diff writes rows without a header (`export.ts:41`). ❌ Mismatch.

## Verdict
Lead with a clear recommendation — **Approve / Approve with nits / Request changes** — and the single most important reason. Then the three passes as sections. Keep code nits concise; make the customer-voice findings vivid and cited.

## Save (optional)
Offer to save the review summary: `add_source(nature: "guidance", source_type: "document", tags: ["evermuse-plugin","pr-review","pr-<n>"])`. If the bridge allows and the user wants, offer to post it as a PR comment via `call_tool`.

## Evermuse Grounding (required)
Follow `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/using-evermuse/SKILL.md`: verify product → find intent (shaping note/spec) → evidence searches + quotes → cite every customer-voice finding → offer save/post.

Cite every customer-derived claim inline per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/using-evermuse/references/citations.md` — a linked-number code badge [`1`](URL).
